Brief Description:
COVID-19 Spread Simulation

Goal: To use processing to model the spread of Covid-19 in a community. 

Overview: We will start with a simple base simulation, such as tree burning, where depending on transmission rates (using real data from the CDC and other health organizations), there would be a visual representation of people catching Covid or others that donâ€™t. We will then build up on that model by adding multiple variables that can be toggled on and off like modes. One of the variables we will include are the 3 major US vaccines: Johnson+Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna. Modes will be utilized to simulate a population with only one or all three vaccine types along with an unvaccinated population. We could see how these various factors play a role in spreading or preventing covid when run individually or together. We will add other factors into the model, such as the decrease in effectiveness of the vaccines, the effects of masks on the spread of covid, etc. These will be represented as numbers and/or visually in our simulation.
