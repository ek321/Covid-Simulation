Brief Description:
COVID-19 Spread Simulation

Goal: To use processing to model the spread of Covid-19 in a community. 

Overview: We will start with a simple base simulation, such as tree burning, where depending on transmission rates (using real data from the CDC and other health organizations), there would be a visual representation of people catching Covid or others that donâ€™t. We will then build up on that model by adding multiple variables that can be toggled on and off like modes. One of the variables we will include are the 3 major US vaccines: Johnson+Johnson, Pfizer, and Moderna. Modes will be utilized to simulate a population with only one or all three vaccine types along with an unvaccinated population. We could see how these various factors play a role in spreading or preventing covid when run individually or together. We will add other factors into the model, such as the decrease in effectiveness of the vaccines, the effects of masks on the spread of covid, etc. These will be represented as numbers and/or visually in our simulation.

Marie's Work Log:
05/23/22--I worked on a skeleton of the Person class. I added all the instance vvraibles that we plan on using and just commented out the ones for future development phases.
05/24/22--I worked on the catchCovid method and its helper method calcCovid. This calculates the chance of someone getting covid based on the number of positive neighbors that they have and their vaccine status (so far, more contingencies will be added later). I also added a parameter to it so that when it is called, I can incorporate the number of covid-posiitve neighbors.
05/25/22--I made accessor methods for the x and y coordinates of the Persons on the screen. I also implemented age into the catchCovid methods, so if a person is elderly then, their chance of getting covid increases by 50%. Lastly, I updated the prototype document to reflect new changes we made.
05/27/22--I added boosted and mask modes to the simulation. This included updating the constructors for the Person class and added methods to determine the impact that wearing a mask or being boosted would have on a Peron's chance of catching covid.
05/31/22--I changed the inital setup for the simulation so that the user will know what to input for the simulation to run. In order to do this, I changed the draw method so that it displays text for the user to have as a key, then after they press the 'd' key, the simulation runs. Something I am working on is erasing the text from the screen when the simulation runs

Esther's Work Log:
5/24/22--I worked on set up, color, key pressed, and vaxType to create the array of Person. This will visualize the data that is being processed and allow the user to change settings. This will set the color for each person and fill in the corresponding pixel box based on the covid status. vaxType is used to set the vaccination status for each person in the 2D array.
5/25/22--I worked on setting up an initial infected portion of the population (randomly chosen). I added a countdown in draw (will probably move it later) to test out the simulation/visualization. I wrote spread in order to push the simulation forward, but it is bugged right now. I worked on neighbors infected for the person class to calculate covid status.
5/26/22--I fixed the broken timer in draw so that we can slow it down and speed it up. I also added the random element in the person class for catching covid.
5/30/22--I fixed the covid counter in the corner so that I stops going ahead of what is on the screen.
